   <p> <strong>Murgh Makhani (Butter Chicken)</strong> is a well-known Indian dish originating from the Punjab region. Chicken thighs (I used boneless) are marinated in a yogurt spice mixture overnight. They are basted in ghee or butter and grilled (traditionally in a tandoor), until just cooked, then finish by simmering in a spiced tomato cream sauce. It is served with naan, roti, paratha, or rice.</p>
